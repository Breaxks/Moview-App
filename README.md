Hi, I'm Matthew Christian Hansel Budhiono â€“ a Business Information Technology student with a passion for building interactive and user-friendly applications.

Iâ€™ve developed this Breaxk Movie App, which allows users to explore movies with features like:

Trending Movies: View the most popular movies of the week.
Search Movies: Easily search for your favorite movies.
Movie Ratings: See the ratings for each movie, color-coded for better visual understanding.
Movie Overview: Get detailed overviews for each movie.
This app is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and integrates with the TMDB API to provide up-to-date movie data.
